# Base Node Types Advanced Deploy

The Coalesce Base Node Types Package includes:

* [Work Advanced Deploy](#work-advanced-deploy)
* [Persistent Stage Advanced Deploy](#persistent-stage-advanced-deploy)

<h2 id="work-advanced-deploy">Work Advanced Deploy</h2>

The Coalesce work node is a versatile node that allows you to develop and deploy a Work table/view in Snowflake.

A Work node serves as an intermediary object and is commonly employed to store raw data before undergoing the crucial phases of transformation and loading into the main tables of the data warehouse.

This pivotal step ensures that the raw data is processed and structured effectively.

### Work Advanced Deploy Node Configuration

The Work node type has two configuration groups:

* [Node Properties](#work-advanced-deploy-node-properties)
* [Options](#work-advanced-deploy-options)

### Work Advanced Deploy Deployment

#### Work Advanced Deploy Initial Deployment
When deployed for the first time into an environment the Work node of materialization type table will execute the below stage:

**Create Work Table**
This will execute a CREATE OR REPLACE statement and create a table in the target environment.

When deployed for the first time into an environment the Work node of materialization type view will execute the below stage:

**Create Work View**
This will execute a CREATE OR REPLACE statement and create a view in the target environment.

#### Work Advanced Deploy Redeployment

After the WORK node with materialization type table/transient table/view has been deployed for the first time into a target environment, subsequent deployments may result in either altering the WORK Table or recreating the WORK table.

####   Altering the Work Tables and Transient Tables

There are few column or table changes like Change in table name,Dropping existing column, Alter Column data type,Adding a new column if made in isolation or all-together will result in an ALTER statement to modify the Work Table in the target environment.

The following stages are executed:

* **Rename Table| Alter Column | Delete Column | Add Column | Edit table description**: Alter table statement is executed to perform the alter operation.

#### Work Advanced Deploy Recreating the Work Views

The subsequent deployment of Work node of materialization type view with changes in view definition,adding table description or renaming view results in deleting the existing view and recreating the view

The following stages are executed:

* **Create View**

#### Work Advanced Deploy  Drop and Recreate Work View/Table/Transient Table

When the materialization type of Work node is changed from View to table/transient table,the following stages are executed:

* **Drop view**
* **Create or Replace Work table/transient table**

When the materialization type of Work node is changed from table/transient table to View,the below stages are executed:

* **Drop table/transient table**
* **Create Work view**
  
When the materialization type of Work node is changed from table to transient table or transient table to table,the below stages are executed:

* **Drop table/transient table**
* **Create or Replace Work table/transient table**

> üìò Materialization Work Node
>
> When the materialization type of Work node is changed from table/transient table to View and use Override Create SQL for view creation. This ensures that the following change is made in the stage function in Create SQL tab so that the order of deployment is maintained.

### Work Advanced Deploy Undeployment

If a Work Node of materialization type table/view/transient table are deleted from a Workspace, that Workspace is committed to Git and that commit deployed to a higher level environment then the WorkTable in the target environment will be dropped.

### Fact Advanced Deploy Deployment

#### Fact Advanced Deploy Initial Deployment
When deployed for the first time into an environment the Fact node of materialization type table will execute the below stage:

* **Create Fact Table**: This will execute a CREATE OR REPLACE statement and create a table in the target environment.

When deployed for the first time into an environment the Fact node of materialization type view will execute the below stage:

* **Create Fact View**: This will execute a CREATE OR REPLACE statement and create a view in the target environment.

#### Fact Advanced Deploy Redeployment

After the Fact node of materialization type table has been deployed for the first time into a target environment, subsequent deployments may result in either altering the Fact Table or recreating the Fact table.

#### Altering the Fact Tables/Transient Tables

There are few column or table changes like Change in table name,Dropping existing column, Alter Column data type,Adding a new column if made in isolation or all-together will result in an ALTER statement to modify the Fact Table in the target environment.

The following stages are executed:

* **Rename Table| Alter Column | Delete Column | Add Column | Edit table description**: Alter table statement is executed to perform the alter operation.

#### Recreating the Fact Advanced Deploy Views

The subsequent deployment of Fact node of materialization type view with changes in view definition,adding table description or renaming view results recreating the view

The following stages are executed: 

* **Create View**

### Fact Advanced Deploy Undeployment

If a Fact Node of materialization type table is deleted from a Workspace, that Workspace is committed to Git and that commit deployed to a higher level environment then the Fact Table in the target environment will be dropped.

This is executed in stages:

* **Drop table/view**

#### Drop and recreate Fact View/Table/Transient

When the materialization type of Fact node is changed from View to table/transient table,the following stages are executed:

* **Drop view**
* **Create Fact table/transient table**

When the materialization type of Fact node is changed from table/transient table to View,the following stages are executed:

* **Drop table/transient table**
* **Create Fact view**
  
When the materialization type of Fact node is changed from table to transient table or transient table to table, the following stages are executed:

* **Drop table/transient table**
* **Create Fact table/transient table**

> üìò Materialization Type of Dimension node
>
> When the materialization type of Dimension node is changed from table/transient table to View and use Override Create SQL for view creation,ensure that the below change is made in the stage function in Create SQL tab so that the order of deployment is maintained.

<h2 id="factless-fact-advanced-deploy"> Factless Fact Advanced Deploy</h2>

The Coalesce Fact UDN is a versatile node that allows you to develop and deploy a Fact table in Snowflake.

A factless fact table is used to record events or situations that have no measures, and it has the same level of detail as the dimensions

#### Factless Fact Advanced Deploy Initial Deployment
When deployed for the first time into an environment the Factless Fact node of materialization type table will execute the below stage:

* **Create Fact Table**: This will execute a CREATE OR REPLACE statement and create a table in the target environment.

#### Factless Fact Advanced Deploy Redeployment

#### Altering the Fact Tables/Transient Tables

There are few column or table changes like Change in table name,Dropping existing column, Alter Column data type,Adding a new column if made in isolation or all-together will result in an ALTER statement to modify the Factless fact Table in the target environment.

The following stages are executed

* **Rename Table| Alter Column | Delete Column | Add Column | Edit table description**: Alter table statement is executed to perform the alter operation accordingly

#### Drop and recreate Factless Fact Table/Transient Table
  
When the materialization type of Factless Fact node is changed from table to transient table or transient table to table,the below stages are executed

* **Drop table/transient table**
* **Create Factless Fact table/transient table**

### Factless Fact Advanced Deploy Undeployment

If a Fact Node of materialization type table is deleted from a Workspace, that Workspace is committed to Git and that commit deployed to a higher level environment then the Fact Table in the target environment will be dropped.

This is executed in two stages:

* **Drop table/view**
